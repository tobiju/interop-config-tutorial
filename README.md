# interop-config-tutorial
This is an implementation example for [interop-config](https://github.com/sandrokeil/interop-config).

## Implementation of `ObtainsOptions` in RepositoryFactory. 
In this repo I implemented an example for using the `ObtainsOptions` 
from interop-config in your own project. The `RepositoryFactory` implements the `ObtainsOptions` interface. 
The `ConfigurationTrait`  in this class will check if all expected configuration params were set in the `config/main.php`. 

## How to run this repo
Just clone the repo, composer install and run interop-config. 

If you never used composer before you will find more infomations at [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/).
